# Music-Player
Simple music player
It is a simple music player with different songs and corresponding images. 
I was learning how to build it with Traversy Media on youtube. I learned a lot while doing it, I also decided on a slithly different design and other changes.
I used my JS and CSS skills and learned new things about HTML audio API.
I hope you enjoy playing some nice music with it! :)
